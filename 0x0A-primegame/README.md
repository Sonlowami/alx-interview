# 0x0A - Prime Game

Maria and Ben plays a game of prime numbers. Maria starts by finding a prime number less than or equal to n, and removes all it's multiples. Ben then continues. The looser of this round is the one who misses a prime number.
They play x rounds and we know the general classification winner, ain't that cool?
